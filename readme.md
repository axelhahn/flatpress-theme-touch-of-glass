# Axel's theme A Touch Of Glass

## Inroduction

This is a theme for the blog software flatpress (<https://www.flatpress.org/>). 
My theme is based on the code of Leggero theme. Thanks go to NoWhereMan and Drudo!!

This theme offers a clean blog like frontend. This theme was made because
- I wanted a larger font size and 
- I need wider space for the posts
- a selected category or selected year+month is not highlighted or shown in Flatpress
