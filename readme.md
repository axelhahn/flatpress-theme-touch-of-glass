# Axel's theme A Touch Of Glass



## Inroduction

This is a theme for the blog software flatpress. Its code is based on Leggero
theme. Thanks go to NoWhereMan and Drudo!!

This theme offers a clean blog like frontend. This theme was made because
- I wanted a larger font size and 
- I need wider space for the posts
- a selected category or selected year+month is not highlighted or shown in Flatpress



## Features

- available areas: 
  - top menu bar for static widget "menu"
  - left column
  - right column
- integrated icon set fontawesome 5.8
- header with search field and links to RSS feeds
- frontend widgets get an icon in header
- the selected category filter or archive filter is highligted in the frontend widgets
- In the blog header the filtered category or date is shown
- If a blog post is shown then categories and time will be marked
- admin area gets warmer colors and icons from fontawesome icon set
